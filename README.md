# Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is Shahaf


I am a self-taught programmer and software developer. 
Alongside being a passionate developer, I have been a pianist, a clay sculptor, an Origami artist, a painter, my whole life. 
I also sketch and draw, compose music for the piano, as well as write and compose songs of my own.

I am a full-time Computer Science and Software Engineering teacher in high school, and I work on side projects and my hobbies in my free time.

I currently teach the following courses:

- Programming in Python
- Programming in C#
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Networking and Data Systems Engineering
- State Machines Theory
- Deep Learning

I was also a mentor of an FLL team and a member of an FRC team.


#### Fun fact: In my native language, the meaning of my name is a seagull ðŸª½, sounds bad, but it's not a rare name where I live.

My main fields in software development are: 
- Finance, Quantitative Programming, and Algorithmic Trading
- Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Genetic Algorithms and Neuro-Evolution
- real-time large-scale systems for data handling, storing, serving, and communication
- and more...

### I have worked (or still working) on projects like:
  - Automatic real-time cryptocurrency markets screening framework, for local recording and broadcasting data through Websockets and REST APIs.
    
  - Cryptocurrency Arbitrage framework for developing systems to detect inside-exchange and cross-exchange Arbitrage opportunities in real-time across the markets, to process, analyze, record, and trade accordingly.
    
  - A framework for dynamically building REST APIs in Python, and controlling during run-time their behavior.
    
  - A Socket-based networking framework in Python, for modular, composition-based programming, enabling building large-scale servers and clients easily, building communication protocols without limit, and composing complex custom data streaming systems.
    
  - Auto license plate recognition and extraction using Machine Learning.
    
  - A Genetic Algorithm framework for building robust yet dynamic and elegant learning environments, including the neat algorithm for multi-modal evolution of Neural Networks.
    
  - A video editing framework in Python, fully supporting video and audio, enabling you to load and save, cut and merge, edit, replace, and everything in between.
    
  - A Python wrapper around AliceVision's Meshroom Photogrammetry software, for automatically creating 3D models from source images of an object.
    
  - A Python extension for adding to the language overloading, object casting, dynamic and automatic type enforcement at runtime, protected private attributes, and more.
    
  - A package containing objects to easily control loop or conditions-based operations, in single and multi-threading, with pausing and unpauding capabilities, timeout and delays, input arguments and real-time output storage, running, rerunning, terminating, and automatic exception handling. All by method calls and declaration - no if statements, try statements, logic, loops, or threading required.
    
  - Some more projects: Text-to-speech, Speech Recognition, Text Sentiment Analysis, black-and-white image colorization, and more.
