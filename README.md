# My name is Shahaf


I am a self tought programmer and a software developer. I love programming so mutch, yet it isn't my only passion, nor is it my only subject of interest.
I have been a clay sculptor, an Origami artist, a painter, and a pianist, for more than a decade. I am also compose classical music for piano, and write songs, as well as compose them.

I am also learning right now phisics, biology, electronics, 3D modeling, systems engineering, programming and sortware engineering.
Currentry, I am working on my degree of Computer Science in university.

I was teaching Python programming in junior high last year.
Currently, I teach Computer Science and Software Engineering in high school, as a part-time job, but also teach there additional hours for free, to volunteer there.
I also work as a private teacher for the same subjects.
(Funny fact: I graduated less than I year ago, from the same high school I teach in right now, and because I studied there in an independent fast program, some of my current students were my classmates.)

I like going on hikes and working out very early in the morning.
My main fields in programmig are software architecture, constructing programming tools, libreries and APIs development, full stack development, Machine Learning, 
Deep Learning, Genetic Algorithms, Natural Language Processing, algorithmic trading, Data Science and Data Analysis, and AI in general, and also robotics. 

I mainly use for development:

(Programming Languages)
 - Python
 - C#
 - Java
 - C/C++
 
(Data Processing Libreries)
 - Pandas
 - Numpy
 - Open-CV2

(ML Libraries)
 - Tensoflow
 - Keras
 - PyTorch
 - Huggingface Transformers
 - Scikit-Learn
 - Scipy

(Web/REST API Tools)
 - FastAPI
 - Uvicorn

(Algo Trading Software Development)
 - ccxt
 - python-binance
 - yfinance

(GUI Development)
 - Pillow (Python)
 - TKinter (Python)
 - Kivy/KivyMD (Python)
 - Android (Java/Kotlin)
 - Flutter (Dart)
 - Flet (Python)

(IDEs - by JetBrains only)
 - Pycharm (Python)
 - IntelliJ (Java)
 - Clion (C/C++)
 - Rider (C#)
 - DataLore (Python)
 - DataSpell (Python)

### I have developed projects like:
  - Automatic highly-profitable trading systems for cryptocurrency, stock and Forex, and arbitrage, some based on Machine-Learning.
  - A framework for building REST APIs using the wonderful dynamic and alive behaviour of Python.
  - Passive auto source code documentation generation for python projects.
  - PineScript to python program convertor and executer, with reproducible generated python code from PineScript.
  - Project creation and management system for AI drivven virtual assistant development, for custom neural network modeling, dynamic dataset, and learning process.
  - Auto license plate recognition and extraction using Machine Learning.
  - Text to code conversion supporting programming languages like: Python, C#, C, C++, Arduino, and Java, with auto syntax completion, and auto live speech to code system.
  - Auto 3D models rendering from source images of a model file, easily integrated as a CLI app or a python module.
  - Simple utils packages for: Text To Speech, Speech Recognition, Text Sentiment Analysis, Sockets wrapper, image colorization, python addons to enable overloading, true private and public, dynamic type enforcement in runtime, and more.

### Fun fact: In my native language, the meaning of my name is a seagull.
