# My name is Shahaf


I am a self tought programmer and a software developer. I love programming so mutch, yet it isn't my only passion, nor is it my only subject of interest.
I have been a clay sculptor, an Origami artist, a painter, and a pianist, for more than a decade.

I am also learning right now phisics, biology, electronics, 3D modeling, systems engineering, programming and sortware engineering.
Currentry, I am working on my degree of Computer Science in university.

I like going on hikes and working out very early in the morning.
My main fields in programmig are software architecture, constructing programming tools, libreries and APIs development, full stack development, Machine Learning, 
Deep Learning, Genetic Algorithms, Natural Language Processing, algorithmic trading, Data Science and Data Analysis, and AI in general, and also robotics. 

I mainly use for development:

(Programming Languages)
 - Python
 - C#
 - Java
 - Arduino
 - C/C++
 
(Data Processing Libreries)
 - Pandas
 - Numpy

(ML Libraries)
 - Tensoflow
 - PyTorch
 - Huggingface Transformers
 - Scikit-Learn

(Web/REST API Tools)
 - FastAPI
 - Uvicorn

(GUI Development)
 - Pillow
 - TKinter
 - Kivy/KivyMD
 - Android
 - Flutter

(IDEs - by JetBrains)
 - Pycharm
 - IntelliJ
 - Clion
 - Rider
 - DataLore
 - DatSpell
 - Gateway

### I have developed projects like:
  - Automatic trading system for cryptocurrency and algorithmic trading development.
  - Passive auto source code documentation generation for python projects.
  - PineScript to python program convertor and executer, with reproducible generated python code from pinescript.
  - Project management system for AI drivven virtual assistant development, for custom neural network modeling, dynamic dataset, and learning process.
  - Auto license plate recognition and extraction using Machine Learning.
  - Text to code conversion supporting programming languages like: Python, C#, C, C++, Arduino, and Java, with auto syntax completion, and auto live speech to code system.
  - Auto 3D models rendering from source images of an object, as an API, using a remote GPU server, with a GUI desktop app as a client, as well as a client library and a CLI for both client and server.
  - Simple utils packages for: Text To Speech, Speech Recognition, Text Sentiment Analysis, Sockets wrapper, image manipulation.

### Fun fact: In my native language, the meaning of my name is a seagull.
