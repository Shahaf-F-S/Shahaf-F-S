# My name is Shahaf


I am a self taught programmer and software developer. Along side being a passionate developer, I have been a pianist, a clay sculptor, an Origami artist, and a painter, my whole life. I also compose classical music for piano, as well as write lyrics and music for my songs from time to time.

I am also learning right now phisics, biology, electronics, 3D modeling, systems engineering, programming and sortware engineering.

I am a Computer Science and Software Engineering teacher in highschool, as well as in juniorhigh.
I also work as a private teacher for those subjects.

I was also a mentor of an FLL team, and a team-member in an FRC team.

During my studies in highschool,
I completed Computer Science and Software Engineering in 1 semester, instead of 6, while compliting 2 other majors.

I was hired by the same highschool I graduated from, after only a couple of months, to teach Computer science and Software Engeeniring, where I am currently a full time teacher.

#### Fun fact: In my native language, the meaning of my name is a seagull, but don't worry, it's not really a rare name where I live.

My main fields in programmig are finance and quantitative programming, Machine Learning, 
Deep Learning, Genetic Algorithms, Natural Language Processing, and algorithmic trading.

### I have developed projects like:
  - Automatic real-time cryptocurrency markets screening framework.
  - Cryptocurrency Arbitrage framework for developing systems to detect single-exchange and multi-exchange Arbitrage opportunities across the markets, process, analyze, record them, and trade accordingly.
  - A framework for building REST APIs and Bluetooth or Sockets servers that behave as a modern APIs do.
  - A fully customisable python module for pretty printing, representing, and processing python objects and their data.
  - Project creation and management system for AI drivven virtual assistant development, for custom neural network modeling, dynamic dataset, and learning process.
  - Auto license plate recognition and extraction using Machine Learning.
  - Text to code conversion supporting programming languages like: Python, C#, C, C++, Arduino, and Java, with auto syntax completion, and auto live speech to code system.
  - Auto 3D models rendering from source images of an object, easily integrated as a CLI app or a python module.
  - Simple utils packages for: Text To Speech, Speech Recognition, Text Sentiment Analysis, Sockets wrapper, image colorization, python addons to enable overloading, true private and public, dynamic type enforcement in runtime, and more.
