# My name is Shahaf


I am a self-taught programmer and software developer. 
Alongside being a passionate developer, I have been a pianist, a clay sculptor, an Origami artist, and a painter, my whole life. 
I also compose music for the piano, as well as write lyrics and music for my songs from time to time.

I am a Computer Science and Software Engineering teacher in high school, as well as in junior high.
I also work as a private teacher for those subjects.

I was also a mentor of an FLL team and a team member of an FRC team.

During my studies in high school,
I completed Computer Science and Software Engineering in 1 semester, instead of 6, while completing 2 other majors.

I was hired by the same high school I graduated from, after only a couple of months, to teach Computer Science and Software Engineering, where I am currently a full-time teacher.

#### Fun fact: In my native language, the meaning of my name is a seagull, but don't worry, it's not really a rare name where I live.

 - uvicorn
 - sockets
 - requests
 - selenium
 - bs4 (beautiful-soup)

(Finance libraries)
- blankly
- yfinance
- TALib

(Cryptocurrency libraries)
 - ccxt
 - cryptofeed

(GUI Development)
 - Pillow (Python)

 - Clion (C/C++)
 - Rider (C#)

### I have developed projects like:
  - Automatic real-time cryptocurrency markets screening framework.
  - Cryptocurrency Arbitrage framework for developing systems to detect single-exchange and multi-exchange Arbitrage opportunities in real-time across the markets, to process, analyze, record, and trade accordingly.
  - A framework for building REST APIs and Bluetooth or Sockets servers that behave as modern APIs do.
  - A fully customisable python module for pretty printing, representing, and processing python objects and their data.
  - Project creation and management system for AI drivven virtual assistant development, for custom neural network modeling, dynamic dataset, and learning process.
  - Auto license plate recognition and extraction using Machine Learning.
  - Text to code conversion supporting programming languages like: Python, C#, C, C++, Arduino, and Java, with auto syntax completion, and live voice feed option.
  - A python wrapper around AliceVision's Meshroom Photogrammetry software, for automatically creating 3D models from source images of an object.
  - Some more projects: Text To Speech, Speech Recognition, Text Sentiment Analysis, Sockets wrapper for modern development, black&white image colorization, python module for adding to the language overloading, true private and public, dynamic and automatic type enforcement at runtime, and more.
