# Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is Shahaf


I am a self-taught software developer. 
Alongside being a passionate developer, I have been a pianist, a clay sculptor, an Origami artist, and a painter, my whole life. 
I also sketch and draw, compose music for the piano, and write.

I am a full-time Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Systems Engineering and Robotics teacher in high school, and I work on side projects and my hobbies in my free time.

Courses have taught and currently teach:

#### Fun fact: In my native language, the meaning of my name is a seagull ðŸª½, sounds bad, but it's not a rare name where I live.

The fields of software engineering in which I'm most interested, are: 
- Finance, Quantitative Programming, and Algorithmic Trading
- Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Genetic Algorithms and Neuro-Evolution
- Cyber-Security, networking and communication, spying on devices, remote take-over, virus and worm design, and more.
- real-time large-scale systems for data handling, processing, storing, serving, and transmission by network
- and more...

### Some of the projects I have worked on (or still am working on):
  - Automatic low-memory, async, real-time cryptocurrency framework for screening, recording, modeling, experimenting, and sharing data. Also manages high-level trade chain representations, including an arbitrage engine.
    
  - An interface and communication protocol framework for controlling computers through json based messages. Capable of crafting simple os commands up to sequential and automated advanced control commands.

  - Automation and orchestration system for controlling one computer using another, with a flexible and dynamic python/JSON based interface. Enables encapsulated/shared memory for processes, running commands sequentially/in parallel, creating custom commands, manipulating memory, transferring and creating files, executing code, running shell commands, and more.
        
  - A Socket-based networking framework in Python, for modular and asynchronous composition-based programming, enabling building large-scale servers and clients easily and efficiently, with custom callbacks, data storing, and automatic updates and transmissions of data across systems.
    
  - A Texas-Hold'em framework, with an efficient probability engine to compute all possible outcomes of the game at any stage, and calculate chances of success according to multiple criteria. Includes a game engine to run the game, vision card detection, and is easily integrated with web APIs.

  - Dynamic and pythonic packet sniffing system based around scapy sniffing, but much more modular, with real-time control over sniffing processes, a dynamic JSON supporting filtering system, for constructing static filters in real-time.
    
  - A CLI tool for binding programmatically many files into an executable, able to run custom commands using the specified files.
    
  - A python librery for extracting, decrypting and collecting sensitive data from the local databases of all major web-browsers, on windows, linux, and mac.
    
  - Auto license plate recognition and extraction using Machine Learning.
        
  - A video editing framework in Python, fully supporting video and audio, enabling you to load and save, cut and merge, edit, replace, and everything in between.
    
  - A Python wrapper around AliceVision's Meshroom Photogrammetry software, for automatically creating 3D models from source images of an object.
    
  - A composition-based framework for easily controlling loops and conditions-based operations, in single and multi-threading, asynchronous, with pausing and unpausing capabilities, timeout and delays, input arguments and real-time output storage, running, rerunning, terminating, and automatic exception handling.
