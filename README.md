Currentry, I am completing my degree of Computer science and Biology.

I like to go on hiking, long runs and workouts very early in the morning.
My main focus in programmig are backend, modules, libreries and APIs development, full stack development, Machine Learning, 
Deep Learning, Genetic Algorithms, and AI in general, and robotics, mainly uding Python, C#, Arduino, C and SQL. 

I have developed and I = am working on projects like:
  - Passive auto source code documentation generation for python projects.
  - project management system for AI drivven vistual assistant development, for custom neural network modeling, dynamic dataset, and learning process.
  - Auto license plate recognition and extraction using Machine Learning.
  - Text to code conversion with auto syntax completion, and auto live speech to code system.
  - Auto 3D models rendering from source images of an object, as an API, using a remote GPU server.
  - Simple utils packages for: Text To Speech, Speech Recognition, Text Sentiment Analysis, Sockets wrapper, image manipulation.

*Fun fact: In my native language, the meaning of my name is a seagull.
