# My name is Shahaf


I am a self-taught programmer and software developer. 
Alongside being a passionate developer, I have been a pianist, a clay sculptor, an Origami artist, and a painter, my whole life. 
I also compose music for the piano, as well as write lyrics and music for my songs from time to time.

I am a Computer Science and Software Engineering teacher in high school, as well as in junior high.
I also work as a private teacher for those subjects.

I was also a mentor of an FLL team and a team member of an FRC team.

During my studies in high school,
I completed Computer Science and Software Engineering in 1 semester, instead of 6, while completing 2 other majors.

I was hired by the same high school I graduated from, after only a couple of months, to teach Computer Science and Software Engineering, where I am currently a full-time teacher.

#### Fun fact: In my native language, the meaning of my name is a seagull, but don't worry, it's not really a rare name where I live.

My main fields in programming are finance and quantitative programming, Machine Learning, 
Deep Learning, Genetic Algorithms, Natural Language Processing, and algorithmic trading.

 - Java
 - C/C++
 - Arduino
 
(Data Processing Libreries)
 - pandas
 - numpy
 - cv2 (opencv)
 - scipy

(ML and DL Libraries)
 - tensoflow
 - keras
 - pytorch
 - huggingface-transformers
 - scikit-learn

 (Networking Libraries)
 - FastAPI

 - Clion (C/C++)
 - Rider (C#)

### I have developed projects like:
  - Automatic real-time cryptocurrency markets screening framework, for local recording and broadcasting data through Websockets and REST APIs.
  - Cryptocurrency Arbitrage framework for developing systems to detect single-exchange and multi-exchange Arbitrage opportunities in real-time across the markets, to process, analyze, record, and trade accordingly.
  - A framework for building REST APIs and Bluetooth or Sockets servers that behave as modern APIs do.
  - Auto license plate recognition and extraction using Machine Learning.
  - Modern Sockets framework based on dynamic socket objects capable of switching between protocols, specified as a dependency, injected into each socket object.
  - A Python wrapper around AliceVision's Meshroom Photogrammetry software, for automatically creating 3D models from source images of an object.
  - A Python extension for adding to the language overloading, object casting, dynamic and automatic type enforcement at runtime, protected private attributes, and more.
  - Some more projects: Text-to-speech, Speech Recognition, Text Sentiment Analysis, black-and-white image colorization, and more.
