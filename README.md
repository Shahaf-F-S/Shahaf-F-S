# My name is Shahaf


I am a self-taught programmer and software developer. 
Alongside being a passionate developer, I have been a pianist, a clay sculptor, an Origami artist, a a painter, my whole life. 
I also compose music for the piano, as well as write and compose songs.

I am a Computer Science and Software Engineering teacher in high school, and have been previously teaching in Junior high.
I also work as a private teacher for those subjects.

I currently teach the following courses:

- Programming in Python
- Programming in C#
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Networking and Data Systems Engineering
- State Machines Theory
- Deep Learning

I was also a mentor of an FLL team and a team member of an FRC team.


#### Fun fact: In my native language, the meaning of my name is a seagull, but don't worry, it's not really a rare name where I live.

My main fields in programming are finance and quantitative programming, Machine Learning, 
Deep Learning, Genetic Algorithms, Natural Language Processing, and algorithmic trading.

Tools, libraries, and languages I typically use:

(Programming Languages)
 - Python
 - C#
 - Java
 - C/C++
 - Arduino
 
(Data Processing Libreries)
 - pandas
 - numpy
 - cv2 (opencv)
 - scipy

(ML and DL Libraries)
 - tensoflow
 - keras
 - pytorch
 - huggingface-transformers
 - scikit-learn

 (Networking Libraries)
 - FastAPI
 - uvicorn
 - sockets
 - requests
 - selenium
 - bs4 (beautiful-soup)

(Finance libraries)
- blankly
- yfinance
- TALib

(Cryptocurrency libraries)
 - ccxt
 - cryptofeed

(GUI Development)
 - Pillow (Python)
 - tkinter (Python)
 - kivy/kivyMD (Python)
 - Android (Java/Kotlin)
 - flet (Python)

(IDEs - by JetBrains only)
 - Pycharm (Python)
 - IntelliJ (Java)
 - Clion (C/C++)
 - Rider (C#)

### I have developed projects like:
  - Automatic real-time cryptocurrency markets screening framework, for local recording and broadcasting data through Websockets and REST APIs.
  - Cryptocurrency Arbitrage framework for developing systems to detect single-exchange and multi-exchange Arbitrage opportunities in real-time across the markets, to process, analyze, record, and trade accordingly.
  - A framework for dynamically building REST APIs in Python.
  - A Socket based networking framework in Python, for modular, composition based programming.
  - Auto license plate recognition and extraction using Machine Learning.
  - A Genetic Algorithm framework for building robust yet dynamic and elegant learning environments, including the neat algorithm for multi-modal evolution of Neural Networks.
  - A Python wrapper around AliceVision's Meshroom Photogrammetry software, for automatically creating 3D models from source images of an object.
  - A Python extension for adding to the language overloading, object casting, dynamic and automatic type enforcement at runtime, protected private attributes, and more.
  - Some more projects: Text-to-speech, Speech Recognition, Text Sentiment Analysis, black-and-white image colorization, and more.
