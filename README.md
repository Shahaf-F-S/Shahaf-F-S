# Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is Shahaf


I am a self-taught software developer. 
Alongside being a passionate developer, I have been a pianist, a clay sculptor, an Origami artist, and a painter, my whole life. 
I also sketch and draw, compose music for the piano, and write.

I am a full-time Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Systems Engineering teacher in high school, and I work on side projects and my hobbies in my free time.

I currently teach the following courses:

#### Fun fact: In my native language, the meaning of my name is a seagull ðŸª½, sounds bad, but it's not a rare name where I live.

The fields of software engineering in which I'm most interested, are: 
- Finance, Quantitative Programming, and Algorithmic Trading
- Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Genetic Algorithms and Neuro-Evolution
- real-time large-scale systems for data handling, storing, serving, and transmission by network
- and more...

### I have worked (or still working) on projects like:
  - Automatic low-memory, async, real-time cryptocurrency framework for screening, recording, modeling, experimenting, and sharing data. Also manages high-level trade chain representations, including an arbitrage engine.
        
  - A Socket-based networking framework in Python, for modular and asynchronous composition-based programming, enabling building large-scale servers and clients easily and efficiently, with custom callbacks, data storing, and automatic updates and transmissions of data across systems.
    
  - A Texas-Hold'em framework, with an efficient probability engine to compute all possible outcomes of the game at any stage, and calculate chances of success according to multiple criteria. Includes a game engine to run the game, vision card detection, and is easily integrated with web APIs.
    
  - Auto license plate recognition and extraction using Machine Learning.
        
  - A video editing framework in Python, fully supporting video and audio, enabling you to load and save, cut and merge, edit, replace, and everything in between.
    
  - A Python wrapper around AliceVision's Meshroom Photogrammetry software, for automatically creating 3D models from source images of an object.
    
  - A Python extension for adding to the language features like overloading, casting, dynamic and automatic type enforcement at runtime, protected private attributes, and more.
    
  - A composition-based framework for easily controlling loops and conditions-based operations, in single and multi-threading, asynchronous, with pausing and unpausing capabilities, timeout and delays, input arguments and real-time output storage, running, rerunning, terminating, and automatic exception handling.
    
  - Some more projects: Text-to-speech, Speech Recognition, Text Sentiment Analysis, black-and-white image colorization, and more.
