### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### My name is Shahaf,
and I am a self tought programmer. Although a love programming so mutch, it isn't my only subject, nor interest.
I am also a scalpture, origami artist, pianist, and I have been painting and drawing for as long as I can remember myself.
I am also learning right now phisics, biology, electronics, 3D modeling, systems engineering, programming and sortware engineering.

I like to go on hiking, long runs and workouts very early in the morning.
My main focus in programmig is Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Genetic Algorithms, and AI in general. I have already
writen several AIpackages and Graphical User Interface applications that use AI.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on personal projects of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Genetic Algorithms, and AI in general.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning phisics, biology, electronics, 3D modeling, systems engineering, programming and sortware engineering.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about biology, systems engineering, 3D modeling, phisics and programming (of course).
- âš¡ Fun fact: In my native language, the meaning of my name is a seagull.
